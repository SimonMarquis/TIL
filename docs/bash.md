### Command options and positional arguments

!!! quote
    A double dash `--` is used in most Bash built-in commands and many other commands to signify the end of command options, after which only positional arguments are accepted.  
    Example use: Let's say you want to grep a file for the string `-v`.  
    Normally `-v` will be considered the option to reverse the matching meaning (only show lines that do not match), but with `--` you can grep for the string `-v` like this:

```bash
grep -- -v file
```

### Inline comment on multiline commands

```bash
cmd1 `# This is a comment` \
  cmd2 # This is another comment
```

### Merge files together

```bash
time {
    echo "↓↓↓"
    find . -type f -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 cat
    echo "↑↑↑"
} > merged.log
```

### Prefered Bash shebang

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```
